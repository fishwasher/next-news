# The Next News Project

Originally created as a _proof-of-concept_ project driven by the *Next.js* framework that uses *React.js* library and is designed for *Node.js* environment.

The project's goal is a news feed aggregation web site driven by the *Newsfeed API*.

## Project Features

- The project is built upon *Next.js* web framework. It uses *Next*'s standard filesystem-based routing with modern-state _React_ library. All React components are class-free, maintaining internal state via _hooks_, a relatively new addition to _React_.

- Application global state is maintained using _ReactN_ module, which extends _hooks_ to the global scope (No _Redux_ and friends needed).

- LESS CSS pre-processing is used, making sure it works fine within the _Next_ stack.

- Serverless deployment using *Now* cloud platform, integrated with this GitHub repository.
